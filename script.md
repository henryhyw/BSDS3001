# 5-Minute Story Script (smooth read)

Imagine we’re driving past another anonymous warehouse. Inside, it’s a factory for answers: racks of servers, always on, drawing electricity like a small town and shedding heat into cooling systems that can drink water like a small city. The US is the heart of this boom—about 38% of all listed data centers are here, more than the next six countries combined. Even without a federal registry, Business Insider still counted 1,240 US sites built or approved in 2024. The center of gravity, and the impact, is here. **[scroll]**

That impact is concentrated. Just twelve states hold two-thirds of US sites. Northern Virginia alone is 15.8% of all US data centers—329 by BI’s count. Texas sits at 9.8%, California at 7.6%. **[scroll]** Since 2015, establishments have tripled from roughly 18,000 to 55,000, with the steepest climb after 2020. Growth is spreading inland too: Alabama up 984%, Connecticut 915%, DC 677%. **[scroll]** The engine is hyperscale cloud, edge buildout, and AI—hyperscalers are almost four times what they were in 2010, and by 2030 AI jumps from 54% to 71% of workloads, adding about 31 GW of new demand that needs power and cooling. **[scroll]**

Power stress follows that clustering. IEA estimates US data centers used about 183 TWh in 2024—45% of global DC electricity, over 4% of US load—and could rise 133% to 426 TWh by 2030. **[scroll]** It doesn’t hit every state the same way: Virginia’s data centers already use 25.6% of the state’s electricity. Nebraska, Iowa, Oregon, and Wyoming are around 11%. Nevada 8.7%, Utah 7.7%, Arizona 7.4%. **[scroll]** More sites mean more share: Virginia has 666 sites and 25.6% of state load; Oregon, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska cluster near 11%. Utilities in these hubs feel the strain first. **[scroll]**

And the real bottleneck isn’t concrete—it’s the grid queue. A hall can be built in 18–24 months, but big wires or generation often take close to a decade. If you don’t get an interconnection slot, the building just sits. **[scroll]** When grids stretch, households and small businesses see it first in their bills. We can see that in the hubs: California rises from 17¢ to 32¢; Virginia and Texas bend upward after 2021; the US average moves 13.2¢ to 17.1¢. **[scroll]** From 2020 to 2024, establishments jump from about 30,000 to 55,000 (+83%) while US residential prices rise 24% (13.8¢ to 17.1¢). Different scales, same timing. **[scroll]** Look at specific hotspots where buildout shows up on bills: California up 15¢; Texas up 3.4¢; Virginia up 3.0¢ at a 25.6% share; Oregon up 4.0¢ at 11.4%; Arizona up 2.8¢; Nevada up 2.2¢. **[scroll]**

Now shift lenses from electricity to water. Many of these same hubs sit in dry basins—about 40% of US data centers operate in high water-stress areas. **[scroll]** Cooling demand from new builds flows into hyperscale and wholesale sites, and a large slice of that footprint lands where water is scarcest. **[scroll]** A hyperscale site averages about 550,000 gallons a day—200 million a year—enough for roughly 6,500 Americans’ daily household use. A typical wholesale site uses around 18,000 gallons a day, 6.6 million a year. **[scroll]** Water footprints peak in the West: Nevada 20.5, Utah 20.2, California 19.6, Arizona 19.1, New Mexico 13.7—exactly where margins are thin. **[scroll]** High-count states sit on high scarcity scores: California 245, Arizona 129, Nevada 159, Washington 89. Overlay scarcity with footprint and you see bubbles across CA, AZ, NV, UT, and Washington—many sites in already stressed basins. Cooling is pulling from the same basins as households, farms, and ecosystems. **[scroll]**

Pull it together: the US holds 38% of global sites; growth is fast and clustered. In hub states, data centers already take big slices of power and prices have risen post-2020. About 40% of US data centers sit in high water-stress areas. This is a clustering story—load, price pressure, and water strain piling up in the same places. **[scroll]**

So what do we do? Speed to power: reform interconnection queues, publish hosting capacity maps, standardize studies. Hedge locally: storage, hybrids, microgrids, demand-responsive operations. Protect people and water: reclaimed or dry cooling in arid basins, rate guardrails and community benefits, and water-positive pledges paired with waste-heat reuse. **[scroll]** We need the compute, but we need to steer where and how it lands so the boom strengthens the communities that host it instead of straining them.
